# Clarity on purpose

## Create community

I like to create *meaningful community* in a small vertical.

>Personal Examples: 
>- I championed the early Android dev community and created the Android Dev Days in both the US and China at Microsoft
>- I invented and lead the "MyStory" series at Microsoft over multiple years where team members were able to learn about each other in "vlogs"

## Think and Write

I like to *think* and *write* (if it leads to *public recognition*)
>Examples 
>- I explored the concept of "Memory" and its many potential manifestations across Microsoft's ecosystem of applications, services, and OS-es.
>- I championed the idea of observational assistance, specifically from an technologically ambitious POV of 'pixels as the source'.

>Best practice examples
>- Stratechery / Ben Thompson

## Master tools
I like to learn and master tools, to unleash my personal creativity
Examples:
>- I trained neural networks a long time ago and used them as creative tools to generate content
>- I learned to use an advanced video editing app to be a better creator of content
>- I run a personal website based on Gatsby
