Remember, life is not a zero sum game. If it was, we'd still be sitting in caves. But too often this simple truth gets lost during working hours. 

Funding projects has gotten more challenging. Employees are on the edge. It's easy to suddenly see requests for help from other teams as an "either or". You win or I win. This puts me in a "fight a battle" rather than a "how do we create the most surplus value together" mindset. I remind myself the whole point of work is to make the pie bigger, rather than get a larger slice of a shrinking one. Creation as opposed to redistribution.

I found it powerful in any work situation to ask the question of "How do we make this win-win?". Building things with 10% more effort so two teams can use it, and it doesn't have to be built twice. Getting promoted because you built a new business rather than outmaneuvered your colleagues.  

It starts with simple things like doing walking 1:1s outside on a sunny day - a chance to enjoy a gorgeous summer while having a productive discussion and getting stuff done. Surplus, not an either-or.
