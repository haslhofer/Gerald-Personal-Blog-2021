My name is **Gerald Haslhofer**. In my professional life I currently lead a team of more than 300 engineers across Redmond, London, Beijing, Suzhou and Hyderabad working on Cross-Device and Mobile Experiences. Our YourPhone app / Link-to-Windows recently was #1 in the Google Play Store! Our team develops SwiftKey, Microsoft Launcher / Surface Duo Shell, and the Microsoft ToDo apps. I enjoy running large distributed engineering teams across the full stack of client, services, and machine learning. 

![I aspire to be an innovator at work. My goal is to create novel, meaningful products and forums as a risk-taking innovator and teacher. I try to be a role model at work of championing change, integrity, hard work and results. So that my example helps others be the best they can be.](/media/image-2.jpg)   

Before Microsoft I ran my own start-up, and worked as a strategy consultant for Bain & Company. I hold both a doctorate from my alma mater in Austria, and an MBA.

As a hobby, I love coding. I live in Bellevue, WA with my amazing wife and three children.
