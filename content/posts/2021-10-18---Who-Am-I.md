# A strong, centered person 
Stay healthy and fit. Create islands of peace and reflection. Cherish our time as a couple and family. Learn new and deepen existing skills. Be the best I can be. 
# A kind husband, father  
Love my wife and children unconditionally. Re-affirm my love through actions regularly. Raise my children with their true long-term welfare in mind. Connect with them and make them feel part of our family. Maintain connection with close family.
