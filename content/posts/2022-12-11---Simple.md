Virtually every morning, for many many years now, I take a yellow post-it-note and write a few lines of gratitude to my wife. Before I walk to work (I live close to my office) I stick the note to a place where I know she'll find it. Sometimes on the kitchen counter, sometimes on top of her coffee cup in the car. This has had an outsized effect on my life - it reminds me every day how lucky I am to have her; how much there is to be happy about in our past; how much I have to look forward to for our future adventures; or just saying thank you for simple mundane things like her purchasing that pair of jeans for me. It's 5 minutes every day where I get to focus on the things and the person that ultimately matters most in the grand scheme of things.
