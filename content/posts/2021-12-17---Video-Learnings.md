## Video editing: a fresh start
I was looking for a capable video editing app that would allow me to do simple things like creating simple video clips, but later also scale to more advanced projects such as animations or 3d graphics. Da Vinci Resolve 17 seemed like a perfect fit - the free version scales far beyond a hobbyist's needs, and has a breadth of training materials on YouTube. 

## Team logo animation

Apart from simple video editing I wanted to embark on a more ambitious project - a logo animation for my team at work. I ultimately created a 4 second video clip that consisted of a few distinct scenes:
- An introduction of the logo with a fade in and zoom effect
- A first transition to the final logo in combination with the subtext (team name). I used a digital glitch effect that allowed me to animate with a very large logo initially, and continue with a much smaller logo without having to complete the zoom effect all the way.
- Introducing the team name with a left-lower third text animation
 - A subtle fade out applied with different speeds to both logo and text, augmented with a very subtle lens blur effect in the final milliseconds of the fade out 

The picture below shows the high-level animation elements in Da Vinci Resolve
