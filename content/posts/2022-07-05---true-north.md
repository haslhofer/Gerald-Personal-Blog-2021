Doing the right thing is rarely easy, but always worth it.

"Taking the shortcut is cheating" my 9-year old son vehemently postulated while we were having dinner at the Refugio Bruto Carestiato on our 110km long-distance hike through the Italian Dolomites. Our family of five had completed day 6 out of 8 of hut-to-hut hiking on the breathtaking classic Alta Via 1 trail. My wife and I had decided to cut a few miles out of our final full day. 20km of hiking through steep Alpine terrain, including some scrambling to cross Cime de Zita seemed to be just too much. "We came here to do the full trek, and if we take the short-cut we'll never be able to say we actually completed it" my son continued his forceful argument. Our legs were hurting, our backs were aching, I was hesitant to change plans. But he was right that 'True North' is rarely easy, but always worth it. After all of our kids agreed, we cancelled the taxi that night, packed extra water and snacks, and finished the 10hr final leg of the trail tired but proud that we did the right thing - it wasn't easy, but so worth it. A great 'reverse mentoring' lesson from son to father, no doubt.
