We had just gone from one to three children after being surprised by having twins. So some years ago my wife and I decided that it was the right time to build a cabin for our family. 

We love the outdoors, and getting ready for an hour of cross-country skiing now required more logistics than traveling overseas for a month when we were just a couple. Having a place to stay close to the mountains would allow us to spend more time as a family doing things rather than driving to do things. We had a clear vision of what we were optimizing for and tradeoffs we were willing to make. We looked at more houses than I dare to remember to understand what felt right for us, avoiding mistakes others had made. We were at peace with the energy it would take to realize this vision. At the end it turned out to take 5 years, with pivots along the way that deserve another essay, but we persevered despite many setbacks.

During that time it struck me as odd that I spent more time and mental energy designing this cabin and picking out light fixtures than I had spent coming up with a durable design for my life and picking the high level priorities I would optimize for, and tradeoffs I'd not be willing to make. 

Don't get me wrong - I was never the person to just stumble through life. I always had a deep conviction of the importance of education and how much it would unlock the world for me, having grown up in a nondescript suburb of a steel town in a small country in Europe. I didn't make any rushed choices around who I'd share my life with - until I met the love of my life and then didn't hesitate for a second.

But life is full of choices, small and large. Unless your priorities are clear, unambiguous, and written down, chances are high you'll start drifting. Just like when building a house, you'll invest hours in selecting the tile but compromise on the location when pushed to make a choice. Small bad choices will accumulate.
