Wow - Twins - Surprise! So some years ago my wife and I decided that it was the right time to design and build a cabin for our family of now 5. 

We love the outdoors. Getting ready for an hour of cross-country skiing with three babies in diapers now required more logistics than traveling overseas for a month when we were just a couple.

Having a place to stay close to the mountains would allow us to spend more time as a family doing things rather than driving to do things. We had a clear vision of what we were optimizing for and tradeoffs we were willing to make. We looked at more houses than I dare to remember to understand what felt right for us, avoiding mistakes others had made. We were at peace with the energy it would take to realize this vision. We paid handsomely for an architect. At the end it turned out to take 5 years, with pivots along the way that deserve another essay, but we persevered despite many setbacks.

The end result was something we were content with. It fulfilled our original vision because we understood our True North.

During that time it struck me as odd that I spent more time AND mental energy designing this cabin and picking out light fixtures than I had spent coming up with a DURABLE DESIGN FOR MY LIFE, deciding the top priorities I would optimize for, picking the activities to align with them, having clarity of the tradeoffs I'd be willing to make. 

Don't get me wrong - I was never the person to just stumble through life. I always had a deep conviction of the importance of education and how much it would unlock the world for me. I didn't make any rushed choices around who I'd share my life with - until I met the love of my life and then didn't hesitate for a second. I didn't pick jobs at random, and took risks starting a company and moving across continents for a great opportunity to work at Microsoft.

But life is full of choices, small and large. I realized that unless my priorities are CLEAR, CONCISE and WRITTEN down, chances are high I'd start drifting. Just like when building a house, you could invest days in selecting the tile but compromise on the location when pushed to make a choice. Small bad choices will accumulate. And then you end up not liking the end result.

My friend Priya encouraged me to write this essay because, yes, this story does have a happy ending. 

I decided to write down my personal mission statement in three succinct paragraphs. I designed the high-level direction I'd attempt to compare my choices against. It took a few attempts to craft these, see if they rang true to what I deeply felt would be a rewarding life, and not what I thought others wanted me to be. I am predisposed to trying to please people so that was a hard thing for me personally. Since then, for many years now, I sit down (usually around the holidays) and reflect on whether my True North priorities still fit, and how true my actions and choices are compared to them. Encouragingly, my mission statement has withstood the test of time. It goes like this:

# My Mission Statement 

## A strong, centered, curious person 
Stay fit. Create islands for reflection. Enjoy our time as a couple and family. Grow as an explorer and creator. Do my best, all the time. 

## A kind husband, father
Love my wife and children unconditionally. Re-affirm my love through actions regularly. Raise my children with their true long-term welfare in mind. Connect with them and make them feel part of our family. Maintain connection with close family. 

## A creator at work
Create novel, meaningful products and forums as a risk-taking creator. Be a role model at work of championing change, achieving results through creativity, perseverance and collaboration. 

So when I had a career choice to make recently, I started with first principles - is this new job an enabler for me to flourish as a creator? Will it allow me to take risks? Is it an outlet for my creative energy? When faced with time pressure, do I still create islands for reflection (like this essay)? Is my time spent with other people reflective of my desire to reaffirm my love for my children regularly?

Judge me if you will - I clearly don't excel at these dimensions all the time. To the contrary. But having this stable True North in front of me helps me ground my decisions in something larger, more durable - it's my attempt to consciously design my life rather than letting circumstance direct my journey.

I consider writing my own mission statement as some of the highest leveraged hours I spent in my life. I encourage you to try it, too. And stop worrying about the tiles.
