The joy of little things
We usually talk about the great, infrequent accomplishments in our jobs. But I realize that I find so much joy in the little things around my job every day:

Changing the font on a memo written in Word from Times New Roman to Segoe UI, making headlines bold and colored in an airy hue of blue, changing the distance between the title header and paragraph ever so slightly to give the overall appearance of the document a feeling of lightness and space. And allowing ample distance between the title and first paragraph - so the page feels like someone really cared.

Instead of writing 4 bullet points in an email condensing it down to 3, because 3 items is something people can remember. 2 seems like I didn't care enough to think deeply about it, 4 seems like I didn't care enough to make it more succinct.

Moving my wedding picture just to the right place so I can see it on the margins of my Teams call video screen, reminding myself how lucky I am to have found the love of my life.

Installing a great microphone so I can talk softly on video calls conserving my energy to think rather than waste it talking loudly.

Printing my todo list on the office printer and crossing items out with a sharp pencil because it creates such a visceral feeling of accomplishment.

Starting the day with three things to accomplish written on the whiteboard in front of me, and leaving the office knowing I at least got these three things done, even though it feels all I did was end up with more unread emails than when I started.

Color grading a video message I send to the team with a high-end editing tool even though nobody will notice.

Seeing ideas I planted many months ago getting picked up and evolved by others.

Working with someone in another company whose best man at his wedding comes from the town in Austria I grew up in - and us finding time as humans and not robots to discover this little random fact.

What little things give you joy?
