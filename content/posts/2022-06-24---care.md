If you genuinely care about the goal, you'll focus on the system.

For a recent business meeting I needed to "dress up" and decided to try on my wedding suit pants which I had purchased 14 years ago. The pants fit just fine. Keeping a healthy weight was always important to me - but I wasn't able to achieve it by sheer will power, but rather by setting up a system I called my "circuit breaker" where I defined an upper boundary at which I'd cut back a little for a few days. For the system to work, I needed to weigh myself consistently. I convinced myself that my weight would probably be lowest in the morning, so I conditioned myself to look at my weight first thing in the morning after I get up. So the system of "accessible scales, consistent weighing, circuit breaker" worked for me over the course of literally decades.
