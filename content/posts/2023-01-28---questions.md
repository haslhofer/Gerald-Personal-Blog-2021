Every day I participate in a myriad of "review meetings". Many of them - to my great excitement - have turned to document format which drives more clarity than endless presentations. Still, many of these reviews don't go well - clearly answering two simple questions would have made all the difference:

1) What goal are you REALLY trying to achieve?
2) What is the worst that could happen? Seriously, the worst?

A lack of clarity around your goals, whether on a micro level for a specific feature review, or on the macro level for the goals of your life, is a huge miss. When answered clearly, unambiguously, with very few words that a 6th grader would understand, without jargon, in one paragrpah, can unlock the success of large groups of people. You align on what success really looks like. You enable groups to coordinate and move in the same direction. It doesn't matter if it's a product group, engineering team, or I guess couples or families.

The second question "what is the worst that could happen" is more subtle - it addresses FEAR. When an effort is driven by the fear of the unknown, ambition suffers, conservatism settles in. But only high ambition will drive impactful outcomes. You can tame your or your team's fear by putting it in focus - what REALLY is the worst outcome? Why reduce ambition if the worst outcome - when put into words - is really not *that* bad. Or it can be mitigated. Explicitly spelled out fears, whether mitigated or not, unlock ambition. 

What's the worst that could happen asking for funding for a dream project of yours? Likely the answer is, surprisingly "nothing" (apart from your own feelings being hurt). But the best possible outcome will transform your career.
