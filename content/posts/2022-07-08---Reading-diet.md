I'm putting myself on a reading diet after discovering that my social media and programmed feed consumption again has taken more space in my life than it deserves. Like any diet, success is predicated on two things happening in parallel - healthy (brain) food and healthy reading habits. 

** Healthy (brain) food. At least for me, the more accessible content is generally lower quality. While there's a gem or two in my programmatic feeds from time to time, most of the articles I read have catchy titles but ultimately don't really teach me anything worth learning. Just like filling up a fridge with healthy choices and locking the unhealthy choices away, I'm lining up a weekly pipeline of high-quality content that's easily accessible. High-quality defined as peer-reviewed, long-form content, books, seminal articles, thought pieces recommended by people I trust. My north-star goal is to occupy at least 80% of my time spent reading related to my job, core professional and personal passions to foster true learning rather then reinforcing existing beliefs or skills. 

A little side story: a while ago a few like-minded friends at Microsoft (across a variety of departments such as marketing, research, development) were willing to run an experiment with me. We called it "30 papers in 30 days". We created a Teams channel where we shared thought provoking content that covered domains we are usually not exposed to in our day jobs, including a short description of "why it matters". It was a wonderful way to learn something new from media sources we generally didn't consume from. To the second point below, it also helped us start shape a new healthy daily habit.  

** Healthy habits. Reinforced by the mechanics of the attention economy the hardest part of my reading diet is to break the cycle of my habitual feed scrolling. While moving feeds to less prominent places on my cell phone is helping a little, I achieve better results by so called 'habit stacking'. I like reading before I go to sleep, so I reprogrammed my habit of feed scrolling to "read at least one page of my high-quality content queue". Of course once I read one page, I read many, and it's been the most stable way to change behavior for me.

While the first days of any diet are painful, my mind now feels reinvigorated, lighter, more curious, more inspired by the diversity of thinking that has become so accessible with today's technology if used the right way.
