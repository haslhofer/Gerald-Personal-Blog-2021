One of my fond childhood memories is about my dad stashing his travel per diems away in an envelope and then using the money (once there was enough of it!) to buy the best tools he could find for his DIY projects at home. Over the years he enabled himself to weld staircases, restore a 100 year old house, and build his own sauna. 

His golden rule "a job done right needs the right tools" stuck with me. His collection and command of a wide array of tools in a pre-YouTube world still dazzles my mind today even though my dad passed away 8 years ago. 

While I don't own a 'Werkstatt' (shop) with physical tools as he did, I learned from his passion and tried to apply it in a different realm. I have over the years compiled an eclectic collection of 'frameworks' which I consider my thinking tools. My goal every year is to add at least one software tool with a decent level of mastery to my kit - recently I got enamored with the power of video editing tools and have even used a green screen to produce short videos for my team; during my current vacation I've been learning an open-source 3d modeling tool called Blender; and gaining a basic level of Python programming skills has opened the world of AI experiments for me. 

Consciously, consistently investing energy and time in your toolkit is one of the most powerful professional enablers I can point to.
