Surprisingly, going with the wind isn't the fastest way to your destination. A life lesson from windsurfing. 

I could barely hold onto the sail as the wind picked up on Lake Cle Elum. I felt the thrill of the board speeding up as I pulled the 6m sail harder and harder away from the prevailing wind direction. The physics of windsurfing has two surprising lessons - just sailing directly down wind is slower (and far less fun!) than going at an angle. And you can use the force of the wind, counter any intuition, to sail upwind. 

Every company, every team has their prevailing winds, and I've seen those who just pulled up their sail and let themselves drift right where the wind was taking them struggle. I've seen colleagues fail when going directly against the wind (the 'no-go' zone). But I've seen those succeed who dared to surf at an angle, who accelerated, determined their own direction and harnessed the power of the wind, rather the being determined by it. 

Ultimately the wind's power exceeded my skill level and I plunged into the water, head first. But life lived at its fullest requires me to pull myself back onto the board, forget about the calluses on my hands, and pull the sail out of the water, into the wind, and start right over.
