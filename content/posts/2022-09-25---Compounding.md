The compounding effect of opportunity and stepping out of your comfort zone

As a 12 year old boy I participated in an international children's summer camp in the Netherlands for four weeks. It was by far the largest step outside of my comfort zone. Spending 4 weeks in a foreign country without my parents, traveling with only three other Austrian boys and girls and a young guide by train across Europe, and then staying 4 weeks with kids from literally all over the world in a camp and with host families on the weekends. Most of us barely spoke English. I had never traveled without my parents. 

In a truly transformational way it opened my eyes to how large the world actually was, how little I knew about it, and how easy it was to overcome our language and cultural barriers and have a great time together as kids. 

I learned that I could succeed far outside my comfort zone.

This ONE opportunity of spending material time abroad as a kid had a drastic compounding effect in my life. It encouraged me to improve my English skills. It opened the door to studying in Scotland during my bachelor degree. It gave me confidence that I could succeed pursuing an MBA at a US university - a very exotic thing to do where I grew up. And it ultimately opened the door to getting a job offer on a different continent and me packing my bags to start a life in the epicenter of high tech on the US West coast. 

In previous posts I've focused on the importance of learning and building skills. But I've learned that if I stay "local" in the most general sense, my impact might be an order of magnitude smaller than by stepping outside of my comfort zone and stepping into a new opportunity space. SKills require opportunity to have impact. Opportunity without skills will just be a lost opportunity. And the further I step outside my comfort zone, the larger the opportunity will ultimately be.

These four weeks abroad as a kid literally opened so many doors and drastically changed the course of my adult life - but it required me to step "outside" and overcome the fear of the unknown.
