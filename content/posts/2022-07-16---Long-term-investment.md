Standing in the parking lot with three babies in diapers, we had a decision to make: turn around in the face of unexpected snow, or persevere in the face of adversity. We had hoped for a fun hike up in the Cascades, and spent all morning packing gear and supplies - a Chariot double 'stroller' with large wheels and hiking attachment for our new-born twins (for me to pull pioneer style), a heavy backpack for my wife Rachel to carry Sophia,the older baby, pacifiers, milk, all sorts of supplies essential for babies.

We reminded ourselves that it's better to be 100% consistent with our values than 99% of time. 

We envisioned our family to be active explorers of the world, with a love for the outdoors, mountains, rivers, the beauty of our planet. We also intuitively understood that unless we invested in the long-term, consistently, that we wouldn't be able to realize this vision. 

There's a hard thing about hard things.

Last week we completed our second family long-distance hike through the Dolomites in Italy. I look back almost 10 years since we pulled our kids through the snow and I'm grateful we decided to keep walking.
