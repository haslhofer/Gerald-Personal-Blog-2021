Thoughts on platform pieces.

- Facilitate easy integration (remove barriers), large upfront fixed cost amortized across all platform consumers
- Creating modularity
- start with narrow vertical focus, then expand horizontally
- key question is how to create value, before it can be shared. A partner is who you enable.
- willing to share customer data? facilitate flows across products?
