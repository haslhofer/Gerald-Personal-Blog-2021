How do you successfully innovate - a hard won lesson of an innovator at heart.

My simplest, most fundamental insight is "only change one variable at a time". This is a hard won lesson. It's based on multiple decades of experience driving innovative projects both in a start-up and large tech setting. It sounds trivial, but it's not. I'm an innovator at heart, and I discovered that it's so easy to get ahead of myself.

Change one variable (a customer use case, a technology, a methodology, an infrastructure) at a time, you might succeed. Change two, you'll generally run out of time and funding.

Successes: When we invented programmable surfaces in Windows [such as those beautiful images on the Windows lock screen] we combined an existing set of technologies for a new use case. It turned out to be a huge, durable success. When we enabled feature flighting in Windows we again used an existing methodology and infrastructure for a new use case and gained broad internal adoption. Some of Microsoft's ContextIQ efforts I was involved in are tackling existing use cases with new technologies - with great progress.

Failures: I faced the hardest challenge when going after a new customer use case with an unproven, emergent technology. I generally ran out of time and organizational support, the hardest won lessons overall. I started these with a strong personal conviction. With anything new you compete against the "known knowns", and even the largest tech companies are inherently resource constrained. The existing backlog is always deeper than the allocated people to address it. Trying to find new product/market fit with an emerging technology - both requiring iteration - will eat more time with pivots than any rational management will dare to wait for. I can point to a few of these - cumulatively years of personal investment that would have had a higher chance of success had I sequenced changing variables rather than trying to do all at the same time. 

Don't discard this as an "of course". The life blood of an innovator is to think boldly and not let the naysayers hold you back. But trust me that the lens of "# of variables changed" is worth consideration when you decide to embark on an exhilarating yet exhausting journey towards creating the next new thing.
