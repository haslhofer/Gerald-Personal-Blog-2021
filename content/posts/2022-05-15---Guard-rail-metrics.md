On a recent offsite a colleague and I started talking about how we manage the tradeoffs between office work and life at home and some of the life-hacks we were playing around with. We are both dealing with the stresses of cross-geo work so maintaining a predictable schedule is challenging.

"I religiously track how often I get my kids to bed. And take action if it's fewer than 3 times a week" he said.

A lightbulb went off in my head. He has a system of guardrail metrics for his life! What a rich metaphor.

Engineers know that when you run a complex system you'll eventually encounter failure. Catastrophic failiures are easy to spot (when Netflix goes down they'll know, quickly!). But often it's the accumulation of small problems that ultimately lead to bad outcomes: drift! So engineers define guard rails and automate the measurements and alerts around them. You have a safety system that will protect you against a whole class of problems. Not all of them, but if you choose carefully, you'll have a pretty good safety net and you'll know when you're in trouble.

I realized I didn't have explicit guard rails for many of the areas that are important to me. So it's easy to start drifting. For example: Reading is important to me. It keeps my mind growing. But four years ago I discovered that I hadn't read a SINGLE book for more than half a year. Slow drift in my reading habits had ended in what I personally consider failure. A great guard rail metric indicating intellectual decay!

I still believe that a big reason my wife and I not only survived, but thrived having three young children in diapers at the same time was that we had a guard rail metric that kept us grounded: how many dates did we go on during a month. It seemed like a big waste of money to pay for a baby sitter, having to pick them up and drop them off, only for both of us to fall asleep in a parking lot because we were so exhausted (didn't make it to the restaurant!). But I still believe these hard-won hours being a couple instead of parents made all the difference for us. We wouldn't let this guard rail metric of dates / month slide below a threshold. 

What are your guard rail metrics for life? Do you track them? Do you enforce them? 
I believe it's a powerful way to avoid drift you'll ultimately regret.
