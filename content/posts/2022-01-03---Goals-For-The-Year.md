# Goals for 2022 aligned with Mission Statement (Gerald)

- I will find 1:1 time with Sophia and focus on her wellbeing. 
- I won't be anxious about what will be tomorrow. I will do the most important things I can impact today, and not worry about the outcomes.
- I will prepare for my v-next time (citizenship, clarity what gives me purpose)
