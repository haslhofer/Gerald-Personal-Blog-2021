A few things happening in different spheres of tech that will create a revolution:

Large models that allow the creation of arbitrary scenes
Depth models that allow those scenes to be 3d
Unreal engine that allows real-tine rendering
Generative models along the lines of meta-humans that allow creation of arbitrary human actors
Generative models that put together story lines
A tight TikTok loop to drive convergence
