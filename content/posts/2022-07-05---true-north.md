Doing the right thing is rarely easy, but always worth it.

"Taking the shortcut is cheating" my 9-year old son Luca vehemently postulated while we were having dinner at the Refugio Bruto Carestiato on our 110km long-distance hike through the Italian Dolomites last week. Our family of five had completed the first 6 days of hut-to-hut hiking on the breathtaking classic Alta Via 1 trail. My wife and I had decided to cut a few miles out of our final full day which would have involved 20km of hiking through steep Alpine terrain, including some scrambling to cross Cime de Zita. "We came here to do the full trek, and if we take the short-cut we'll never be able to say we actually completed it" my son continued his forceful argument. Our legs were hurting, our backs were aching, I was hesitant to change plans. But Luca was right that True North is rarely easy, but always worth it. After all of our kids agreed, we cancelled the taxi that night, packed extra water and snacks, and finished the 10hr final leg of the trail tired but proud that we did the right thing - is wasn't easy, but so worth it. A great 'reverse mentoring' lesson, no doubt.
