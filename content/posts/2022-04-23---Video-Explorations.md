## Vacation video
My goal in this project was to create a short vignette of our trip to Jordan in April 2022. I wanted to capture the key sites we visited, animated on a map, synchronized with music, and 3d animation.

## Selecting the photos

- Swimming in the dead sea
- Camel ride in Wadi Rum
- Petra
- Dana nature reserve
- Madaba
- Jerash
- Amman

## Select the sound track

Expect about 20 secs (3 sec / video). Chose epic trailer music from (Pixabay)[http://pixabay.com]

## The Map

Map generator from [http://maps.stamen.com], but ended up taking map from Google Maps
