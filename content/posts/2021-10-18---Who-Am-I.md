# A strong, centered, curious person 
Stay fit. Create islands for reflection and writing. Enjoy our time as a couple and family. Grow as an explorer and creator. Do my best, all the time. 

# A kind husband, father  
Love my wife and children unconditionally. Re-affirm my love through actions regularly. Raise my children with their true long-term welfare in mind. Connect with them and make them feel part of our family. Maintain connection with close family.
