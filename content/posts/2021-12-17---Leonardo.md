The ability to make connections across disciplines - arts and sciences, humanities and technology - is a key to innovation, imagination, and genius.

Curiosity and intense observation

Vision without execution is hallucination

Skill without imagination is barren

Lists of things to learn and who to learn from. Always filled with wonder.

Keep the citizenry amused with dazzling public spectacles.
