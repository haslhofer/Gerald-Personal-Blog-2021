Things you don't like don't help you find things you do like. It's a life lesson I learned as a 16 year old. 

My parents had a lively debate which summer job I should take. I was expected to earn money for at least a month. The options were either hard manual labor (working for an asphalt company) or an office job at the local steel mill. Their argument for manual labor was to teach me a life lesson. Show me what I (a pimple faced computer geek) would likely not survive and scare me off to become a "white-collar" worker down the road. The office job on the contrary to gain experience. Reason prevailed and my parents sent me to the steel mill office job. By then I already had more than half a decade of coding behind me, so I naturally flourished in what turned out to be a "computer job". That summer job unleashed a period of entrepreneurial spirit in me as a high-schooler. The asphalt job wouldn't have added any new signal.

In computer science there's what is called the "explore-exploit" dilemma. In order to achieve good results, you have to spend some time finding a good place to be (explore), and then reap the benefits of that place (exploit). The conundrum is that if you explore too little, you'll get stuck in a crappy place. You always explore, you never reap the benefits either. 

That makes staying in a place that neither helps you explore nor exploit simply a bad, lazy choice. I remind myself that knowing what you don't like does not lead you to knowing what you like, because there's an infinite number of things you don't like.

Working my hard manual labor job would have offered me no further signal where to venture next. Only more places to avoid. Gaining confidence that a 16 year old could do things in an office most adults couldn't emboldened me to try my luck as a software instructor, high-school graphic designer, computer consultant and database developer years before entering college. That bit of gained confidence and self-understanding unlocked me.

I see life as an orchestration of periods of exploration followed by periods of reaping the rewards of having found a good place, rinse-repeat. So I try to focus on things that either give me POSITIVE new signal (explore) or rewards (exploit). If I get neither, I'm likely wasting my energy, being just lazy.
